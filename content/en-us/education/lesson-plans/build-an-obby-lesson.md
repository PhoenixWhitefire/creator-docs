title: Create Your Own Game on Roblox - 1 Hour Activity Plan
description: A classroom activity plan demonstrating how to create an obby using Roblox Studio and AI assistance. 
---
**Lesson Description:** 1 hour classroom activity plan demonstrating how to create an obby game on Roblox. A perfect starting point for anyone. No experience with coding, game development, or AI needed.

Get students familiar with Roblox and Roblox Studio by having them create a classic platformer style game, also called an "obby" on the Roblox platform. Students will practice foundational prompting skills in conjunction with improving their own computational logic.

**ISTE standards:** Innovative Designer 4a, 4c, 4d, Creative Communicator 6b, 6d

### Introduction (3 - 5 minutes)

1. Ask students: "Who can tell me what the Roblox Platform is?"
 Possible answers:
   - Roblox is the ultimate virtual universe that lets you create, share experiences with friends, and be anything you can imagine.
   - Roblox is an online gaming platform and creation system where users can create, share, and play games and virtual experiences created by other users.
2. Ask students: "Who can describe an obby to me?"
 Possible answer:
   - "Obby" is short for "obstacle course." Obbies are jumping puzzles where you must figure out how to jump from Bridge to Bridge without falling. They're one of the most popular types of games on Roblox
3. Ask students: "Has anyone heard of Roblox Studio? What is it?"
 Possible Answer:
   - Roblox Studio is the creation tool used by all experiences on the Bridge. It is available for free so everyone can create and share new Roblox experiences.
4. Introduce Lesson:
   - Explain students will be coding and designing their own obby (obstacle course) that others can play using Roblox Studio.
   - This lesson will show you an example of an obby. For students who have never used Roblox before, this is also a chance to learn how the player controls work.

### Logging in and opening Roblox Studio (5 - 10 minutes)

Logging In and Opening Roblox Studio (5 - 10 minutes)
To use Roblox Studio, you will need a free Roblox account. See <a href="../../tutorials/curriculums/studio/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn About Studio</a>.

While students are logging in, here are some potential discussion topics:

- **Strong passwords:** Emphasize creating unique, complex passwords for Roblox that are different from passwords used on other sites. Discuss why reusing passwords is risky.
- **Recognizing scams:** Educate students about common scams, such as offers for free Robux, requests for login information, or links to unfamiliar websites. Stress that Roblox employees will never ask for passwords or personal information. Teach them to identify legitimate Roblox sites and communication channels.
  - Roblox employees will never ask for your password — Report anyone who asks using the Report Abuse feature.
  - There is no such thing as free Robux — Never trust players or sites who say they have a way to get free Robux!

### Guided tutorial - 35 Minutes

Lead students through the following tutorial: <a href="../../tutorials/curriculums/building/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building lesson</a>.

<h4>Tips</h4>

- **Chapter 1:** Get Started 5 minutes
  - Let students play 2 - 3 minutes. This will give your students an idea of what they are working towards without having to go online. Let students know from the start how much time they have and give a one minute notice before time's up.

- **Chapter 2:** Work with Parts 5 minutes
  - Remind students to rotate their camera view to get an accurate view of their project
  - Some students will be faster than others. Challenge faster students to create more parts for their obby using the greatest variety in size, shape, and rotation they can.
  - Emphasize that students are creating an experience that others can play, not just for themselves.
  - For those needing a greater challenge, encourage the students to experiment with the Properties window. What can they change about the parts?

- **Chapter 3:** Coding with AI 10 Minutes
  - These Assistant requests are written in English to produce a specific and reliable result. Slight changes in grammar and word choice may cause different outcomes.
  - Encourage students to examine the Explorer and property windows to help them formulate prompts for Assistant. Properties is a key concept for those who continue coding.

- **Chapter 4:** Test and Save 10 - 15 minutes
  - After students have saved and tested their games, allow students to switch seats and provide peer feedback
  - If time allows students five minutes to improve their obby based on the feedback provided. Have students switch places and play-test each other's experience.
  - Start by having students offer feedback in the form of two Stars (What they liked) and a Wish (What they would want to see).
  - After receiving feedback, each student should implement a change based on feedback they received.

<h4>General tips</h4>

Introduce students to "Ask Three Before Me": A student needs to ask three peers before asking the instructor for help.
Keep in mind students have different prior experience with computers. Emphasize exact steps when teaching, such as when to double-click or right-click.
Set strict time expectations for accomplishing a task, such as one minute to pick a color for a part, or two minutes to play test.

### Wrap-up 5 minutes

<h4>Discussion questions</h4>

- Why is it still important to learn how code works if AI is so useful?
  - Possible Answers: AI does not always generate the code for actions you intended. Learning to code can help you talk to AI and generate better results.
- Did AI always provide the results you expected? Ask for examples where a student got unexpected results and what the student did in response.
- What types of jobs do you think there are at gaming companies?
  - Possible Answers: Engineers, artists, musicians, organizers (project managers), accountants, moderators. People who train AI.

<h4>Lesson recap</h4>

Roblox, Roblox Studio, how to test games, and why you need to learn more about coding even with helpful AI like Assistant.
