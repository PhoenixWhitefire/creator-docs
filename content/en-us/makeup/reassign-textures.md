title: Reassign Textures
description: To import custom makeup, replace the existing textures on the head template with your custom textures.
---

To import custom makeup textures, use Blender or Maya to reassign the existing textures on the reference template head to your custom texture images. After replacing the textures, export the entire head model and [import](./import.md) the model into Roblox Studio.

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
The following information is **specific for applying makeup textures to the Roblox provided head reference**, which already has PBR texture nodes assigned. For more information on assigning textures from scratch, see [Assign textures in Blender and Maya](../art/modeling/assign-textures.md).
</Alert>

## Video workflows

The following are video workflows for various tasks in exporting textures from a texture editing tool and reconnecting them in Blender and Maya.

Additional notes:

- In the video, the presenter opts to clear all existing image links by navigating to **File** > **External Data** > **Unpack Resources** and selecting **Remove Pack**.
  - This is a method to unassign all images, equivalent to the [Blender](#blender) reassignment step #5.
