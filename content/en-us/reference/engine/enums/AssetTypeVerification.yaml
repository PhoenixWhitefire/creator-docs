name: AssetTypeVerification
type: enum
summary: |
  Determines the asset type verification mode.
description: |
  Determines the asset type verification mode used when calling
  `Class.Humanoid:ApplyDescription()` or
  `Class.Players:CreateHumanoidModelFromDescription()`. This verification mode
  determines if the method will load models or not. Loading models can be
  insecure if it's possible for malicious users to trick your game into loading
  unexpected models that you own which may include malicious scripts. You should
  set this to `Always` unless you want to load non-catalog assets.

  ##### Warning

  The default value for this parameter will change from `ClientOnly` to `Always`
  after 10/20/2025. See
  [here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/potential-action-required-update-for-humanoiddescription-apis/3982903)
  for details.
