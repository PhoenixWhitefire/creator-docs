The **Avatar Setup** tool helps accelerate the avatar character, clothing, and accessory creation process by automatically processing custom models into avatar assets:

1. [Import](#import-a-model) a custom model.
2. Select the model and click on [Avatar setup](#run-avatar-setup) to run.
   1. If your model does not include all the components of an avatar model, the tool attempts to [auto-setup](./auto-setup.md) the model into an avatar asset.
3. [Test and edit](#test-and-edit) the asset.
4. (Optional) [Publish](#publish) the asset to Marketplace.

## Import a model

If you are using a custom 3D asset, import your asset into Studio using the 3D importer tool. To import the model into Studio:

1. From Studio's **File** menu, select **3D Importer**.
2. In the file browser, select your model object.
3. When your model object loads in the 3D Import preview, disable the **Upload To Roblox** option.
   1. This prevents the asset immediately saving to your **Toolbox**, preventing unwanted copies of similar assets.
   2. To save time in the future, click the **&ctdot;** dropdown in the top-right of the 3D Importer window and **Save as New** to create an import profile for this workflow.
4. Verify the preview and any warnings or errors in your model object.
   1. See [3D Importer](../art/modeling/3d-importer.md) for additional information. Certain warnings and errors may require readjusting the model in a third-party software.
5. Select **Import** to add the `Class.Model` instance into your workspace.

   <Alert severity = 'warning'>
   When a new model is imported, it's also added to the moderation queue. If an avatar asset is moderated incorrectly, you will receive a moderation email with a link to appeal. This appeal takes up to 10 minutes to resolve.
   </Alert>

## Run Avatar Setup

When your project has the appropriate `Class.Model` in your workspace, you can begin the avatar setup process.

1. Select the model in the workspace.
   1. If you want to select only specific meshes of your model, navigate to the Explorer, expand the `Class.Model` object, and hold shift and click on the individual mesh objects.
2. With the Model selected, navigate to the **Avatar tab** and select **Avatar Setup**.
   1. If your model requires [auto-setup](./auto-setup.md), the tool begins processing your model. This can take several minutes.
      1. Once auto-setup is complete, a `Class.Model` of your avatar populates in your workspace and in the testing panel. Review any warnings or errors before using any testing or editing tools.
   2. If your model doesn't require auto-setup, the tool populates your avatar asset in the preview panel and you can access the [test and edit](#test-and-edit) functionalities.

## Test and edit

After successfully loading a character model into the tool, the character populates in the preview window with various testing, editing, and preview tools. If you discover any issues that can't be resolved with the edit tools, you may need to update your base input model in your third-party modeling software and/or retry the auto-setup process.

For more information on the various testing interfaces and editing features, see [Test and Edit Tools](./tools.md).

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
It's important to test that your avatar components have correctly generated by testing out different clothing, rigid accessories, and animations.
</Alert>

## Publish

The **Publish** button opens the publish asset dialog, with an option to upload the avatar and any accessory items to the Marketplace. You can only publish assets that are correctly configured as platform avatar assets.

When selecting the Publish option, you can upload the asset to the Marketplace, where you can sell the item paying an [upload fee](../marketplace/publish-to-marketplace.md#upload-an-asset), clearing moderation, and publishing the asset to the catalog.
